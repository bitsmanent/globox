Hello
=====
globox is a platform game for the terminal. It features an ASCII based
interface which don't rely on any external library so it should work out of the
box on any VT100 compatible terminal.

Status
======
The code is working, I'm using it for a while and didn't notice any issue.
Levels are just there to test features so a level set has yet to be built.

Name
====
I choose globox as a working name to start development. Actually I didn't find
anything better yet. It may change though, before the 0.1 is out.
For the curious, Globox is the best friend of Rayman.

Feel free to send a pull request.
